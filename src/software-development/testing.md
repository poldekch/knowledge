# Testing Software

[The Practical Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) by Martin Fowler provides a detailed overview over the different ways that exist to test software (covering both automatic and manual methods), and when to use which.

Many unit tests, but little integration and UI tests. 
The article is _really_ long and the examples are focused on Java and Spring magic, which makes some of them hard to read for people who have not much experience with these technologies. 
It's a nice introduction to the topic, but also people experienced with testing can learn one or two new things or profit from some of the tools mentioned in it.
