## Lean and Agile Insights

* Measuring progress as execution of an untested plan is useless.
  [Paraphrased from _Scaling Lean_.]
  This is basically Eric Ries's _achieving failure_ concept:
  You can be very successful in building something, only to then realize that nobody wants it.

## Metrics and Marketing

Just some keywords to interesting methods:

* AARRR Metrics
* Customer Desire Map
* Design Thinking
* Prioritization using ICE: Impact, Confidence, Ease

## Business Models

_Scaling Lean_'s second chapter, _The Back-of-the-Envelope Business Model Test_, introduces interesting, agile and low-effort ideas on how to design your business model and how to check whether it has a chance to work.

It also suggests increasing your price by not thinking about your costs plus a decent margin, but about the value you provide to your customers.

## Quotes

### Ash Maurya: Scaling Lean

* While empirical learning is part of that process [of building a business], unless you can quickly turn that learning into measurable business results, you are just accumulating trivia.
* If you could double your pricing, and not lose more than half of your customers, you would still come out ahead. […] Fewer customers (less inventory) mean fewer customer support requests and lower operating costs to service them.
* Most entrepreneurs price their products like artists. They struggle to place a fair value on their product and fall back on a cost-based pricing approach […]. A more effective approach is thinking in terms of value-based pricing in which you anchor your pricing not against your cost structure but against the potential value your customers stand to derive from your product. Remember that as long as your customers derive more value from your product than it costs them, it's still a fair transaction.
* "I know that $200/month might be higher than most other services you are using, but given what you have seen (the demo), if you feel you can build something similar working just half a day a month, then you come out ahead and shouldn't buy our product."
* A time-boxed traction goal is much more tangible than a revenue goal.
