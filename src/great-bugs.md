# Great Bugs

An art in its own way.

## I can't print on Tuesdays

I don't want to spoil your fun with this one, so I won't explain it here. 
Just follow the links to [Ubuntu bug #255161](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cupsys/+bug/255161/comments/28) or [Ubuntu bug #248619](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/file/+bug/248619) that resulted from the investigation there.

This bug is my favorite example for when people say something like "that's impossible" or "it appears totally at random".
