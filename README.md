# Some of my Knowledge

_… hoping that it’ll be useful to others._

This repository is supposed to collect many of the bits and pieces of “wisdom” I’ve accumulated over the years. 
Maybe I’ll turn it into some kind of a website at some point (that’s why [everything is in `src/`](https://github.com/scy/knowledge/tree/master/src)), but for now, the most important thing is that I can write stuff down fast.

I also have lots of notes in my WorkFlowy (from when I still used that), but most of those are not public. 
I’ll migrate them when I find the time …
